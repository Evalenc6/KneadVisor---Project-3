# AND101 Project 3 - AnimalApps

Submitted by: **Evan Valencia**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Summary

**KneadVisor** is a place where cats can safely knead and get better at it without the judgemental cat eyes.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: :cat: :baguette_bread: :partying_face:

## Notes

While I may not know how to successfully use the font features I will defintely learn later. Designing the button with the drawable shape was fun
to do and it will defintely allow me to make better looking apps.
